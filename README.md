## REST API for business accounting application

This is a REST API for a revenue tracking application. If you have your own business, for example, you sell something, you probably would like to keep a record of all purchases made from you, see comparative statistics and dynamics. Just create your account, create product categories and products in these categories, and simply record each purchase into the system. Statistics are generated automatically.
